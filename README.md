# Music-Web-App

This web app allows users to create house party 
music set ups controlled by the people in the rooms.
It has a join code you use to join rooms and the
host can set up a room. This uses the Spotify
API to play the music.

For this you'll need NodeJS, material-ui, React 
JavaScript Python and Django.
